 -- has correct value
updated apt-get options to following line. changed lower case dir etc to Dir etc. Added Archives, Lists, State

change init.r to have rGraph load dependencies
run after ./cleanup
-- success!!!
-- (14:54 - 15:11 ... 17 mins on Mac/OSX VMWare 2Gb 1 CPU image)
test on Bluemix
-- fails long long error, missing lstdc++
change init.r to install stringi via install.packages('stringi', configure.args='--disable-cxx11')
change compile to include libstdc++-4.8-dev
-- tested compile change on local ubuntu. apt-get works.
test on Bluemix
