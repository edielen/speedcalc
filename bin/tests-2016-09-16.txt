added print $HOME to compile
added path statements to manifest.yml
  -- path is now being picked up.
using bash engine_test to test and display
  -- Rscript --version works
  -- Rscript engineGlobal_1.3.r does not work
  -- Rscript ./engineGlobal_1.3.r does not work.
  -- documentation appears to indicate that $HOME can be used during build process.
  -- Rscript -e "print(Sys.getenv())" failing. adding --verbose
  -- add to compile:
    ...  echo "new ldpaths is: $(cat $BUILD_DIR/miniconda/envs/r_env/lib/R/etc/ldpaths)"
  -- ldpaths exists and is correct.
  -- continue to get error Rscript execution error: No such file or directory
    ... appears to now indicate that Rscript is not being found.
     - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17496810/usr-bin-env-rscript-no-such-file-or-directory-after-recent-r-3-0-1-install
    ... add additional entry to path to include $HOME/miniconda/envs/r_env/lib/R/bin
    ... no change
    ... execute R --version ... works
    ... execute R -e 'print(Sys.getenv())'  -- verbose ... works
    ... add find -name Rscript, add find -name engineGlobal_1.3.r
     --  all found
     -- /miniconda/envs/r_env/lib/R/bin/Rscript
     -- ./miniconda/envs/r_env/bin/Rscript
     -- ./engineGlobal_1.3.r
    ... or it may be that R is not being found. .... it's a little tough to determine.
    ... add topic "which R $(which R)"  and same for Rscript
    .. $RHOME value is empty even though it is set (last value) in manifest.yml file
  deleted (cf delete inference-engine) existing app, build to clean system.
  added line to engine_test: RHOME = $R_HOME
  -- Rscript loads correctly from engine_test bash script.
add dummy env variable to manifest.yml see if this is a 'last value' issue
  -- it's not a last variable issue
skip to .profile test add R_PROFILE_D_TEST variable, test for value
  -- test fails. .profile not being executed before "command:" from manifest.yml
add dummy env variable to compile, test for value in engine_test
  -- test fails. env variables defined in staging process are not passed to execution process
change .profile target from $BUILD_DIR to $HOME/ in compile exec
  -- not executed
removed variable passing test from compile
change .profile target from $BUILD_DIR to $HOME/.profile.d/.profile in compile exec
  -- failed
remove cat ldpaths from compile
change profile target to cp -f $BUILDPACK_DIR/target.profile $HOME/.profile.d/env.sh in compile exec
  -- failed
change bin/release to execute the env.sh file
  -- attempted to execute env.sh file.
